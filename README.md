Sport: Simple Persistence of Regular Treemodels

This framework allows to define and construct data models based on a tree structure. It defines basic operations (create, update, delete, copy, paste, undo, redo) on the abstract treemodel. Persistence and Presentation are aspects that can be implemented ad libidum. An xml export is predefined, which can be used for persistence, but the concept allows for other persistence like JPA as well.
